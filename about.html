<b>Creator's Profile</b>

Denick John Espares is a college student currently studying
BSIT specializing in Animation and Game Development.
He is already destined to be one of the very best game developers in the world.
Because the world is directed towards
the vicious cycle of generic games,
he decided to redirect it that would change the gaming world forever.


Denick was first a gamer, even before becoming a preschooler.
He was enticed by NES and SNES games especially Popeye, F1 Race, and Battle City.
From then on, he faced many challenges and obstacles that
only made him stronger.


On his 3rd year in high school,
he decided to enter the realm of MMORPGs. He started searching for good
games, joining betas and recommending them to his friends.
Until one day,
he realized how cruel online games can be.
It was then that he decided to become a true game developer and designer.


"I was first a gamer. I was fascinated in games and it changed my life forever.
And so, I decided to be someone who can provide quality games for gamers
like me..."
